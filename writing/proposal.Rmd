March Madness is an annual college basketball team that features 64-68 of the best teams in the country competing in a single elimination tournament.  The basketball tournament is highly watched and followed by sports fans who fill out brackets and try to predict the winners of all 63/67 games (The rules have changed over the years allowing for either 64 or 68 teams). According to [boydsbets.com](https://www.boydsbets.com/many-people-fill-brackets/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20American%20Gaming,the%20conservative%20side%20of%20things.), 70 million brackets are created per year by fans struggling to fill out a perfect bracket.  However, there are 9.2 quintillion possible combinations for brackets making this feat extremely challenging

The data comes from: <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022>.  While there is data from as far back as 1985, for the purposes of this project, only data from 2005 and onword will be used to keep the data more relevant.  Additionally, certain metrics such as (--) were not tracked prior to the 2005 tournament.  Some notes for the variables are that for any of the difference variables, it is measuring team1 minus team0.  Additionally it is worth noting that all the data is focused on a single game in a single season, however teams such as UConn have appeared multiple times in the tournament so the team ID corresponding to Uconn will appear multiple times.  Here are all of the variables:

There are 1,053 observations, however it is possible to double the number of observations by flipping team 0 and team 1 to generate an additional 1,053 observations for a total of 2,106 observations.  Doubling the data will also allow us to better understand the symmetry between the observations.

This is supervised learning because we are interested in predicting whether a team will win or lose based on the 18 variables listed above.  This is also binary classification as there are only two outcomes that we want to predict: win or loss (Games in the tournament cannot end in tie and will play consecutive 5 minute overtime periods until a team wins).  We will likely use advanced methods such as XGBoost because we are mainly concerned in finding the most accurate predictions, and due to the complexity and multi-dimensionality of our predictors in relation to our response
