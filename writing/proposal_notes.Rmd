-   March Madness, most popular college basketball tournament of 64 to 68 teams

-   Some sort of stat on how many fans create brackets per year

-   9.2 quintillion different possible brackets, therefore attempting to predict games is an interesting problem due to the vast amount of possible combinations

-   Great in terms of the class objectives as it is a pure prediction exercise on real and interesting data

##### c

-   All data from <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022>

-   Contains large amounts of data since the 1985 season, but we specifically are planning to use data since 2005 as many interesting metrics are not available before then and to keep findings relevant to modern basketball strategy

-   Variables (note that all differences are the stat of team1 minus that of team0)

-   While there are truly 1053 observations, we duplicate each example and flip team0 and team1 so the model can better learn the symmetry between the examples. Therefore, there are 2,106 entries.

-   18 predictors, 1 binary response

##### d

-   Supervised

-   Binary Classification (whether the team won or not)

-   We will likely use advanced methods such as XGBoost because we are mainly concerned in finding the most accurate predictions

##### e

Can't think of any
